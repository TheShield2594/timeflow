# TimeFlow — Power Apps Code App

A production-ready time tracking app built as a **Power Apps Code App** (React + TypeScript).
Tracks time against projects and tasks, stores data in Microsoft Dataverse, and includes a full reporting dashboard.

## Local Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm or pnpm
- **Linux only:** `libsecret-1-dev` (`sudo apt install libsecret-1-dev` on Debian/Ubuntu). It's pulled in natively by `@microsoft/power-apps` → `@azure/msal-node-extensions` → `keytar`. GitHub-hosted CI runners have it preinstalled; a fresh Linux box doesn't, and `npm install`/`npm ci` fails with a cryptic `node-gyp` build error without it.

### Run locally
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app runs with **mock data** in localStorage when `window.PowerApps` is not present.
There is no seed data — a fresh `npm run dev` starts with an empty workspace; create your first project from the Projects page.

## Deploy to Power Apps

### Prerequisites
1. [Power Platform CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/developer/cli/introduction) installed
2. A Power Apps environment with a Dataverse database
3. Power Apps license (per-user or per-app)

### Step 1 — Authenticate
```bash
pac auth create --url https://YOUR_ORG.crm.dynamics.com
```

### Step 2 — Create Dataverse tables

The app expects these tables (logical names singular, entity-set names get the
`-es` pluralization, e.g. `ever_projects` → `ever_projectses`):

**Table: ever_projects**

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| ever_name | Text | Required |
| ever_color | Text | Hex color e.g. #719500 |
| ever_description | Text (multiline) | Optional |
| ever_ratio | Decimal | Optional — default ratio for new entries |
| ever_jiraticket | Text | Optional |

**Table: ever_workitems** (tasks)

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| ever_name | Text | Required |
| ever_project | Lookup → ever_projects | Required |
| ever_description | Text | Optional |

**Table: ever_timeentries**

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| ever_project | Lookup → ever_projects | Required |
| ever_workitem | Lookup → ever_workitems | Optional |
| ever_description | Text | Optional |
| ever_starttime | DateTime | Required |
| ever_endtime | DateTime | Optional (null = running) |
| ever_durationminutes | Whole Number | Optional |
| ever_ratio | Decimal | Optional |
| ever_jiraticket | Text | Optional |
| ever_date | Date Only | Required |
| ever_userid | Text | Stamped with the Entra ID object id on write |

Active/inactive state uses the standard Dataverse `statecode` column.

> **Row security matters.** Reads filter server-side via FetchXML's
> `eq-userid` operator (Dataverse resolves this to "the calling user" itself,
> so it doesn't depend on comparing stored ids from the client — the SDK has
> returned inconsistent user ids across sessions for the `ever_userid`
> column, which is why that column is stamped for display/audit purposes but
> not used to filter). This still relies on `ever_timeentries` having
> **user-level ownership** configured — `eq-userid` filters against
> `ownerid`, which only has per-user meaning under that ownership scope. Make
> sure the table is configured accordingly, or every user will see all rows.

#### Dataverse Security Configuration

Correct table-level security role configuration is required to keep each user's time entries private.

| Table | Ownership scope | Required privileges |
|---|---|---|
| `ever_timeentries` | **User** | Basic (Create / Read / Write / Delete) |
| `ever_projects` | Organization | Basic (Create / Read / Write / Delete) |
| `ever_workitems` | Organization | Basic (Create / Read / Write / Delete) |

**Why this matters:** Without user-scope ownership on `ever_timeentries`, the app's `eq-userid` read filter (see "Row security matters" above) has no per-user `ownerid` to match against, and every user can read every other user's time entries.

**How to verify in the maker portal:**
1. Go to [make.powerapps.com](https://make.powerapps.com) → **Tables** → select `ever_timeentries`.
2. Open **Settings** → **Advanced options** → confirm *Ownership* is set to **User or Team**.
3. In your Security Role, confirm the `ever_timeentries` row is set to **User** scope for Read/Write/Create/Delete.
4. Repeat for `ever_projects` and `ever_workitems` (Organization scope for shared data is correct).

**Runtime detection (UAT sign-off check):** as defense in depth, on the first
entries refresh `useTimeEntries` calls `hasForeignUserEntries()` to check
whether any returned row belongs to someone other than the signed-in user.
This should never trip given the `eq-userid` read filter above, but if it
ever does, the UI shows a "Data isolation warning" toast and logs detail to
the console — a signal that something is seriously wrong (e.g. an
unexpected Dataverse behavior) and step 2/3 above need to be revisited
before going to production. The check only runs once per page load (a guard
flag skips it on later refreshes) so the toast doesn't repeat on every poll.

    ever_projects {
        guid ever_projectsid PK
        string ever_name "Required"
        string ever_color
        string ever_description
        decimal ever_ratio
        string ever_jiraticket
    }
    ever_workitems {
        guid ever_workitemsid PK
        string ever_name "Required"
        guid ever_project FK
        string ever_description
    }
    ever_timeentries {
        guid ever_timeentriesid PK
        guid ever_project FK "Required"
        guid ever_workitem FK
        string ever_description
        datetime ever_starttime "Required"
        datetime ever_endtime "null = running"
        int ever_durationminutes
        decimal ever_ratio
        string ever_jiraticket
        date ever_date "Required"
        string ever_userid
    }
    ever_projects ||--o{ ever_workitems : "has"
    ever_projects ||--o{ ever_timeentries : "billed to"
    ever_workitems ||--o{ ever_timeentries : "categorizes"
```

### Step 3 — Environment targeting

`src/services/dataverseService.ts` talks to Dataverse through the
`@microsoft/power-apps` SDK code generated in `src/generated/`. Every
`*WithOrganization` call passes the connector's `"current"` token instead of
a baked-in org URL, so there is nothing to configure — a single build
artifact targets whichever environment it's deployed into (dev, QA, or
prod) automatically. There is no `VITE_DATAVERSE_ORG_URL` (or any other org
URL) setting; see `.env.example`.

Lookup writes use the `@odata.bind` form with entity-set paths
(`ever_project@odata.bind: /ever_projectses(<guid>)`); reads surface lookups
as `_ever_project_value`. The mapping lives in the `mapXxx` /
`xxxToDataverse` helpers — the rest of the app does not depend on those
details.

User identity is resolved by `src/services/userService.ts` via the SDK's
`getContext()`, with a persistent local-dev fallback for `npm run dev`.

### Step 4 — Build and push
```bash
npm run build
pac code push
```

### Step 5 — Run in Power Apps
```bash
pac code run
```

Or open Power Apps Studio and the app will appear in your environment.

## Customisation Tips

- **Colors**: Edit CSS variables in `styles.css` under `:root` to change the theme.
- **Adding fields**: Add columns to your Dataverse tables and update the TypeScript types + service layer.
- **Auth**: Power Apps Code Apps use Zero-config Microsoft Entra ID auth — no extra setup needed.
- **Sharing**: Deploy to your Power Apps environment and share with users as you would any Power App.
- **Power Automate**: Add approval flows or Teams notifications by connecting Power Automate to the `ever_timeentries` table on create/update triggers.
